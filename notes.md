ssh -i jhwlds.pem ubuntu@3.221.136.153

Today, I created my server through the AWS. For now, I could not understand everything that I did.
However, it was interesting to login into my server trough the terminal.

I bought a domain for my webstie, called jhwlds.com
Also, I made my website as a secure website through the caddy.

My web site will need interaction with users and possibly get their personal informaition, so it seems to be needed.

I feel like this class has prepared some presets for student to make server, so I am not sure if I could do same things that I did now later on my own.
